# Markov Generated Journal Titles

The code in this repo is used to generate article titles based on titles scraped from the journal "Cognition". The training data includes article titles going back to 1994.

Webscraping and data cleaning were conducted in R. Code is in the `titles.Rmd` file.
Articles were generated using Python.

And just for fun; here are the most frequently used words in Cognition over the last couple decades!
